This can open the door to front-running and sandwich attacks. A sandwich attack is a variation of front-running, where an attacker sees a pending transaction, then places a significantly larger transaction (with the same tokens) directly before and after the victim’s transaction. This drives the price of the victim’s transaction up, effectively allowing the front runner to extract the difference in value. Since the victim's slippage rate is so high, the attacker can extract that much value from the attack. This could easily be prevented by setting a lower slippage.\n                  </p>\n                  <p class=\"text-lg\">Too Low:</p>\n                  <p>\n                    If the slippage rate is set too low, then the transaction can fail (revert) if the price moves beyond the % that was set. While a low rate can prevent front running, it can also cause a user to lose gas fees to the failed transaction.\n                  </p>\n                </div>\n              </tooltip-me-content>\n
